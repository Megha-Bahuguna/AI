## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores the Titanic dataset to understand patterns behind passenger survival.  
I used **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## ðŸ”Ž Steps
1. **Data Exploration** â€“ Checked dataset shape, column types, missing values.  
2. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Filled missing values (Age, Embarked), added new features.  
3. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** â€“ Visualized survival rates by sex, class, age, and fare.  
4. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Created features like `family_size`, `is_alone`, and `cabin_flag`.  
5. **Insights** â€“ Summarized findings on survival patterns.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Women had a higher survival rate than men.  
- 1st class passengers survived more compared to 2nd and 3rd class.  
- Younger passengers had better chances of survival.  
- Passengers traveling alone had lower survival rates.
